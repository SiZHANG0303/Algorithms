## 1- Sorting and Searching
### 1-1 Binary search
* Keep the array in sorted order
* Examine the middle key
* If it matches, return its index
* If it is larger, search the half with lower indices
* If it is smaller, search the half with upper indices
### 1-2 Insertion sort
Insertion sort comes from the idea of bubble sort.

### 1-3 Merge sort
Mergesort: divide the array in half, sort the two halves, merge the two halves to make a sorted whole.
